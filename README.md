## Why This Portfolio Matters

This project reflects my journey as a **self-taught developer**. I built it to learn by doing, improve my frontend skills, and create a space to share what I’m working on — including projects like **Xamsadine AI** and **DeepSynth**.

It’s not just a portfolio — it’s proof that you can grow by building.
